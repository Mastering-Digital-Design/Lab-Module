### Guidelines on Oral & Feedback Session

#### Oral Exam

The assessment for this Laboratory component is in the form of a 10-minute oral and feedback session in the ADIC MSc Lab. Please find your time-slot on the schedule posted in the Lab. 
The purpose of the oral session is to assess your level of attainment in the intended learning outcomes and the extend of your understanding in digital logic and FPGAs. This is a formal assessment as part of the Laboratory component on the MSc course.  

#### Notes and Logbooks

You can bring your logbook or notes (electronics or paper) with you to the Oral Examination. Although your logbook or notes will NOT be “marked” in the conventional sense, the examiner may ask you to refer to specific parts of it during the oral examination, and you can use it to help you answer questions.

#### Format of the Oral 

Before you attend, please set up one set of equipment to your implementation of the echo synthesizer (or recorded video equivalent). You will be asked questions on all four parts of the experiment. We may ask questions not directly linked to what you have done. These questions are designed to determine how much you understand the principles behind the experiment. For example, the assessor will want to find out the extent to which you have mastered the Verilog language for designing hardware, the interpretation of the timing or area results etc.

#### Grading 

There is a marksheet that we  will be using during the oral examination. The assessment form with feedback will be returned to you first week of the Spring term.  Your will receive a grade for this assessment according to the criteria shown below:  

- A* = Outstanding (85%+): Exception grasp of the subject
- A = Excellent (70%+): Understood everything with no gap
- B = Good (60%+): Good understanding with minor gaps
- C = OK (50%+): Fair understanding with major gaps
- D = Weak (40%+): Weak understanding with many gaps
- E = Fail (below 40%): Not really on top of the experiment
